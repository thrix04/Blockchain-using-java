# Blockchain-using-java</br>

Application.java is the actual working of the blockchain concept.
Firstly the block is mined and then only added to the chain.The mined block must meet the security standards.
Block.java creates block of data which is essential part of the Blockchain implementation.
Timestamp of block is also included in it.
Hope this helps for you.
